    "Up to this point we have been including data directly in the Jupyter notebooks. This only works if the data is modest in size, and even then it is not the best practice since data and codes should reside in different places.\n",

    "Now, you are probably familiar with the *directory* structure of your local files: your files are organized in folders (a.k.a. directory), and each folder can contain files and more folders. When you map out that structure, you will find that it assemble a tree, like so:\n",

    "+ To go down one level, specify the name of the child node\n",
