# Week 3 glossary

Here are some python syntax features and functions that you should know after this week's class:

## Syntax feature

+ `for … in …:` : the starting line of a `for` loop
+ `if …:` : the starting line of an `if` conditional and block
+ `else:` : the starting line of an `else` conditional and block
+ `elif …:` : the starting line of an `elif` conditional and block

Also note the use of **indentation** in `for` loop and `if`-`elif`-`else` statements
