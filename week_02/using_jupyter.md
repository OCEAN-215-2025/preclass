# Using Jupyter notebook

## Jupyter notebooks: what and why

In this course we'll execute python codes mainly using Jupyter notebooks. These are files with `.ipynb` extensions. The advantage of Jupyter notebooks are:

+ You can execute python codes in small units, which makes debugging easier.
+ You can execute python codes interactively, i.e., you can switch between debugging and executing fairly seamlessly.
+ You can mix richly-formatted texts with python codes within the same file. This is especially useful if you want to document what your codes are doing.

## Creating, uploading, downloading, and opening a new Jupyter notebook

+ To create a new Jupyter notebook in JupyterHub, click on the `+` symbols either at the top of the main panel or at the top of the left panel, which brings up a launcher. Then, just click on the icon that says "Python 3 (ipykernel)" from the launcher.
+ To upload a file onto JupyterHub, all you need to do is to drag the file from your desktop / file browser to the left pane of the JupyterHub.
+ To download a file onto your computer, right click on the `.ipynb` file from the left pane, and select download.
+ To edit an existing Jupyter notebook, left click on the file on the left pane and it will be displayed on the main panel.

_Note_: in addition to working with Jupyter notebooks, we can also use JupyterHub to preview the contents of text and csv (comma-separated values) files. We will make use of JupyterHub's previewer in later weeks.

## Basic Jupyter notebook manipulation

A Jupyter notebook is comprised of cells. There are 3 types of cells: raw, markdown, and code. In this course we will mainly work with the latter 2 types. Visually, a code cell is distinguished from the markdown cell by a gray background. The markdown cell is used for displaying richly-formatted texts, while code cell is used to execute python codes.

In general, there are two modes of operation when working with a Jupyter notebook: the **command mode** and the **edit mode**. The former is for cell-level operations while the latter is for editing the content within a cell. If you see a flashing cursor in your notebook, you are likely in the edit mode. In addition, the current cell being edited is usually indicated by a tight blue line frame, whereas in command mode the blue frame extends all the way to the left.

A few operations that are useful in command mode:
+ `m` converts the current cell into a markdown cell
+ `y` converts the current cell into a code cell
+ `a` inserts a cell above the current cell
+ `b` inserts a cell below the current cell
+ `c` copies the content of the current cell, and `v` pastes it
+ `d` + `d` deletes the current cell
+ `z` undoes the previous action

## Markdown formatting

In a markdown cell certain characters have special meaning. Some useful examples:
+ To create a list, start the line with a `+`, followed by a space
+ To set a block of texts in boldface, surround the block with a pair of `**`
+ To italicize a block of texts, surround the block with a pair of `_`
+ To set a block of text in monospace, surround the block with a pair of `` ` ``
+ To create headings, start the line with a sequence of `#`, followed by a space (the more `#` the lower the heading in the hierarchy)

## Comments within code cell

Within a code cell you may occasionally see lines that start with a `#` symbol. Such lines serve the purpose of **comments** in the python language. In other words, content of the line to the right of the `#` symbol is ignored by the python executable when the cell is run.

In fact, you can start a comment with a `#` in the middle of a line. The content to the left of the `#` symbol is executed as code, whereas texts after the `#` symbol are ignored.

In Jupyter notebook the role of comments somewhat overlaps with that of a markdown cell. However, when working with a python script, where every line is by default executable codes, comments are useful in helping a human reader to understand what the codes are doing.
